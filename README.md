# Minecraft DanganRonpa
 A hare-brained idea turned reality, see the ReadMe for more

Welcome to my brief history of my biggest project to date so far.

Minecraft DanganRonpa, or MinecraftRonpa as it wound up being called, was a recreation of a popular visual novel series. I ran 4 separate versions, each with custom music and flashy ending executions for all outcomes, to simulate the original murder-mystery battle royale as best I could.

I originally proposed this game as a joke, knowing it would take far too long to create to be practical. Then one of my friends said I couldn't do it. So I did it.

The first two games were tests, to see if the idea would work. I got around a dozen or so of my friends to agree to be the participants, and got to work. After two months of building the map and programming all the game mechanics, as well as the unique executions, we ran the game, and I also filled the mediator role (Which is normally performed by a character named Monokuma in the actual games)

After the first two tests back in 2020, we agreed that you could re-create tha game in Minecraft and not lose the spirit of it. From there, four of my friends joined the production crew to help with writing, building, and being some of the players, allowing me to focus more of my attention to programming. The third game (First public one) occurred in early 2021, running from March to May. It wasn't our best work story-wise, and things were rougher with a group of strangers we recruited via the internet instead of just our friend group, but overall it was still a success.

If you wish to view the six videos we recorded, I will provide a link here, but be warned: The audio and footage quality was... Poor. The game's programming worked, but the recordings were very amateur. And also the vibe is inconsistent.

MinecraftRonpa 2 ran from early 2022 to mid 2022. The same crew that created the first also created the second, and we tried to out-do ourselves (Which I feel we did). The videos for MR2 are currently still in post-production, with one of the other team members on editing duty. Luckily the audio and visual quality has been greatly increased.

I will update this file with the video playlist link once the videos exist.
